  ABSTRACT
</h1>

<p>
Passwords should be secure, but there is rampant abuse of other users credentials to access organizations’ data or users data. Many users credentials have been used to alter sensitive data without their knowledge. Password authentication issues are mostly caused by problems of human limitations, weak passwords, strict password policies, password sharing, users lack security knowledge e.t.c. Text passwords are majorly and commonly used authentication method to protect resources from unauthorized access. These passwords are weak and users still choose weak passwords because of lack of security knowledge and motivation to choose stronger passwords. Strict policies force users to choose stronger passwords at the risk of user resentment and confusion and complex passwords. Motivation and security knowledge help users choose strong passwords willingly.
This study introduces a simple method for password creation including information security training text to help users be more convinced and motivated to create strong passwords. The effectiveness in improving user passwords is also evaluated. The study suggests that users given security training text and method to create passwords will produce their own encrypted strong passwords than users compelled to follow strict password policies.
 The research study suggests that password creation method in addition with information security text will make users to create strong passwords than just providing users with  strict password policies to comply to. The empirical study of two groups: the control group is to be forced to  comply with strict password policies and the experimental group provided with password creation method plus information security training text. The effectiveness in improving user passwords is then evaluated. This will enhance the strength of weak text based passwords and reduce rampant abuse of passwords.

INTRODUCTION <br>
<blockquote>
<p>
1.1	Background to the Study
Text based passwords are still the most the most popular authentication method, unluckily text-based password authentication is quite problematic [1] A good password needs should be secure as suggested by Wiedenbeck et al. [2]. However, passwords are weak based on dictionary words or slight variations. Hence, these passwords are vulnerable to attacks. and risk to be guessed users and attackers that have collected information about the user. Passwords are considered one of the most significant risk factors in terms of security in information systems as they are vulnerable to attacks [3]. This vulnerability is mainly due to choosing weak passwords.
Many users  are not aware of the significance of choosing strong passwords to protect their data. Because, there is a lack of password policy to train and motivate them to compose strong passwords. Policies contain rules forcing users to comply to [4].  Password Security articles like websites, policy papers e.t.c have guidelines but still most users choose weak passwords. Security failures are rampant and it’s difficult to determine which particular policy measure the strong password creation, Some  research indicate that users are not aware of  the risk associated with weak passwords [5, 6].
Shay et al. [7] shows that users  lack motivation to create strong passwords as they do not understand the importance of advice given in the policies. more effective approaches are needed to make awareness of the problems of insecurity practices in authentication, enable  users to conveniently and efficiently create and encrypt their own passwords than restricting their choices with tedious password policy.
Many researches indicate that password policies have failed to motivate users to choose strong passwords, this study suggests coming up with a simple password creation method and also adding motivating element of information security text in the  creation process without enforcing any restriction policies. These excessive restrictions have not been very successful, it is suggested that a system that train and provide efficient password creation method to users will enhance password security. The research investigates whether motivating users with an effective password method and and security training text  to  create strong and secure passwords is better than forcing users to comply to  strict password policies. This is an empirical study to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed password creation method plus information security training text compared to stringent password policies.
The structure of the study is as follows: In the next section, we discuss the background and some related work. In Sect. 3, we give the methodology including the details of the empirical study including the design, measurements, apparatus and procedure. In Sect. 4, we give the results together with an analysis. In Sect. 5, the findings are discussed, focusing on the efficiency of proposed password guideline on improving the strength of the users’ passwords as well as the compliance behaviour. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 6.
1.2	Problem statement
Many users are not  aware of the significance of choosing strong passwords to protect their resources. The stringent password policies are more of commands forcing users to comply to the rules but not helping and motivating users to compose strong secure passwords. It is outlined that password must include mixed characters and must not have dictionary words (Yan et al., 2004). Password security resources  like websites, policy papers  e.t.c. have guidelines , but most users still choose weak  passwords, password security failures are rampant and users  are unable to decide on  policy measure to  strong password creation. Many researches indicate that users underrate the risk associated with weak passwords. (Florencio and Herley, 2007; Zang and McDowell, 2009).
Shay et al. (2010) indicated that users lack motivation to create strong passwords they do not understand concepts   in the guidelines. As  a result , effective approaches are needed to help and motivate users to create strong passwords. Instead of forcing users to choose strong passwords or restricting their choices with tedious password policies.
Text Password is most commonly used authentication method today and in future. Text password is easy to use, affordable and familiar to users. Passwords are used to protect users resources in online and offline environments.
Text Passwords have security risk as they are vulnerable to threats because of choosing weak passwords (Carstens, Mc-Cauley and DeMara, 2004).  Weak passwords are chosen  for easy memorability and this result into coping strategies likes reusing, sharing and choosing weak passwords.
Research Objectives
The purpose of this research is to create a new user-friendly method to password creation, including information security training text / education awareness that motivate and influence users to create more secure text passwords without commanding users .  and to offer solutions security risks caused by weak passwords. The main objectives is to produce a method for password creation including information security training text that motivate and influence users to create secure text passwords. This research aims to find out whether a change in password policies  and advice can bring a new perspective for users and to improve password security . The study will seek to fulfill the following specific objectives:
1.	Investigate current password creation policies in use
2.	Develop a user friendly password creation method including information security text that motivate and influence users to create secure text passwords.
3.	Evaluate the effectiveness of the method with commanding policies in enhancing text password security.

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1	Introduction
To create strong passwords, users are compelled to adhere to commanding policies, the policies command that, the password must contain at least 8 characters ,at least one number or one upper case letter, and must not contain the username. Organizations use different policies, but still does not provide efficient security level [8,9].
Research shows that users have several  password accounts and uses many passwords a day [6]. Users use different passwords for each account to avoid security failure hence users find it difficult to remember all these passwords. Users deal with this situation  by choosing weak passwords , writing down, which is security risk to systems [10]. These are replaced by  suitable authentication behaviour  [11]. These methods correct user behaviour by imposing stringent password policies[12], proactive password checkers/meters [13]  password expiry [14], to enhance security level. Password management systems (Master passwords) are also used to save many passwords in a system to remember easily. This is security problematic since other passwords are protected by master password. Cracking master password lead to access to other passwords. Researches show that these policies, advices, measures, systems have malfunctions and negative security effects. Limitations make users  adopt insecure ways easy to use [15]. Many users do not follow stringent password policies [16].  System administrators and users  are unable to effectively  improve the security of authentication system.
Researches  shows that commanding stringent policies do not enhance the password security [9,12,17]. Users adopt ways like writing down or sharing passwords when forced to use commanding policies to create passwords. Changing the stringent policies content can help users to create strong passwords and enhance security.
Carefully creation of password policies content is vital to give instructions to create secure passwords. Grawmeyer and Johnson [18] investigated users password generation behavior.passwords which were rated as secure were  insecure passwords containing a single word. The researcher suggested that password plicies should be made to reflect users task and understanding.
Few research has been done on password policies building, There is no empirical data showing that the passwords created adhere to the stringent policies [17]. There is no proper research on  NIST policies  used to produce password creation policies [19] The policies are just ideas. Zakaria [20] conducted experiment using user groups given different convincing ideas according to their misunderstanding  to test the compliance to NIST policies. It is difficult to conclude on effect of differences on convincing. Few studies have evaluated efficiency and security of password policies [15,21].
Updated authentication systems NIST policy for managing and accepting user passwords recommended password length, complexity, blacklists, rate limiting and two-factor authentication systems [22].
To improve usability and make systems authentication easy to use the NIST policy imposed restriction on minimum length of password only to be 8 characters long. the authentication policy  allowed long passwords and paraphrases up to 64 characters , copy pasting and displaying the passwords feature/ password hints. But, disallowed compromised blacklisted passwords, password expiry. The study suggests eradicating password policies by providing secure password creation method including information security training text to users to compose passwords without imposing commanding policies. The study compares the findings with the commanding password policies. No adequate study has been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the updated NIST policy because most organizations have not applied the updated NIST policy.
Researches on updated NIST policy focus on compromised blacklisted passwords and two-factor authentication [23, 24, 25, 26].Few studies have been done on updated NIST password complexity policy. The study takes into consideration of eradicating commanding policies and evaluates its efficiency. Besides, encourages users to create strong passwords by providing password creation method including information security text.
 The objective of the study is to teach users to create stronger passwords to improve password security  by password creation method instead of commanding password policy. The method allows users own formula which they can use to turn any simple word to a complex password.
This study also investigates the effect of an information systems training  text provided in giving knowledge to create their unique password creation formula on password strength. The existing password policies only give commanding information on password creation.  Cialdini [27], users easily comply to request when they are provided a reasoning. A study found out that password guideline including a reasoning as to why choosing a strong password is important indeed improved the password compliance [20]. But, the  study did not show how to do it to enhance security. Hence, users are provided an information security traing text  along with  an example method. The proposed method  allows users to willingly create their own strategy on creating passwords. The method aim to inspire users to create their unique encryption formula.
 In summary, this study seeks to discover if users will create strong passwords when provided password creation method along with an information training text, without imposing password policies.
2.2	Password policies/rules
Password restriction policies are rules that dictate the content and format of the passwords accepted by an authentication system. system administrators use these  policies to enhance computer security by guiding users to create more secure passwords.
 In 2006, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) updated the “Electronic Authentication Guideline” [19] this was used by security system administrators for the implementation of electronic authentication. This policy provides facts to measure the strength and efficiency of a password restriction policy considering bits of entropy to determine a password value’s uncertainty. In this guideline, estimation of Shannon’s Entropy [49] was used for the entropy calculation. However, several studies [17,28,29,30] have found that passwords created with particular password policies were more difficult to guess than the ones created with the NIST model suggestions.
 Komanduri et al. [17] conducted a web study to compare four different password restriction policies. The finding was that it is easy to create a 16- character password than an 8-character minimum excluding dictionary words and a 16-characters password provides enhanced security. The researcher measured the password strength using a calculation entropy and indicated how restriction policies affected  password strength  [7],. The finding were that adding digits increased the entropy of passwords, excluding dictionary words decreased the entropy and passwords created by users exceeded the minimum requirements.
 Some researches indicate that password restriction policies do not enhance password security [31]. Laboratory and field studies conducted to test that password restriction policies do not enhance password security [21,32]. Findings are that users have difficulty to create and remember passwords  when forced  to use stringent and complex password policies. Hence users adopt insecure password practices. These policies also help attackers to guess user passwords efficiently by  decrease the number of candidate passwords based on the restriction policy. Florencio and Herley website study,  [33] indicates that users only use restriction policies if they have no other alternative. Most systems use policies requiring  20-bits strong. Users find difficulty in using password restriction policy . The users frequently visit  websites do not care too much to create strong passwords to log and are vulnerable to attackers .
2017 updated NIST guideline stressed on the importance of using  strict password policy rules to create strong passwords [22]. Recommended organizations not to apply  other policies because the length of the password was vital as it affects the strength of the password , hence  suggested the use of long passwords and passphrases. The study proposes password creation method including an information system training text without imposing stringent password policy rules to compose their passwords. The study  aims to motivate users to create cryptographically strong passwords.
2.3	Password Advices/guidelines
These are system password restriction guidelines  on password creation .Most systems that impose password restrictions offer password advice about creating passwords to users . The purpose of password advice to easen password policy adoption and also motivate users to create stronger passwords. The study  examined ten popular Internet sites password practices  which enforce password policy rules and offer password advice  [34]. That the websites’ password restriction policies and password advice differ, inconsistent, ineffective and some ambiguous hence causing  confusion to users instead of helping users. Users are unable to come up with accurate mental frameworks on how to create a secure and memorable password.
 Murray and Malone [35] outline the characteristics of the organizations password advice. The research found out that there are in password advice used in different organizations. Websites enforce different password creation restrictions. Their research also showed that some advice stated as the best practice by security researchers is even not included in the majority of advice. This contradiction may cause users unwillingness to follow advice.
2.3.1	Mnemonic/memorable/easy to remember passwords
Barton and Barton [2]. Proposed use of easy to remember phrase-based passwords to create secure and memorable passwords   Mnemonic passwords are obtained from an easy to remember (memorable) sentence where users generally use a letter of each word in the sentence. Most researches on password advice are about mnemonic passwords, they are not recommended for use in practice [34]. Other studies indicate different ways to generate mnemonic passwords. Vu et al. [21].The researcher used two methods of mnemonic password generation where users chose own sentence. The passwords created had a string of characters and were considered secure. But, had little discrepancy in creation time and login times in two methods. The researcher other study indicated that characters withstand cracking [15]. But, attackers know word substitution and characters suggestion. Mnemonic string method is not secure..
2.3.2 Password chunking/memory holding pieces of information/working memory
Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information.  Chunking breaks up long strings of information into units or chunks.  The resulting chunks are easier to commit to working memory than a longer and uninterrupted string of information.  Chunking appears to work across all mediums including but not limited to: text, sounds, pictures, and videos
 Most researches are on mnemonic passwords and a few on password advices. Some studies on chunking to help users create mnemonic passwords [36,37]. Carstens et al. [38] Researched on applying chunking to organizations password advice.
The content of password advice
 The password should:
-	Contain at least 7 characters,
- be a combination of symbols and letters,
- not contain repeated characters more than twice,
- not be a dictionary word or personal data,
The researcher compared password advice contents to two chunk, three-chunk and four-chunk passwords. The finding was that four-chunk passwords were longer and easy to remember, two-chunk or three-chunk passwords. The research did not evaluate security of created passwords. Four-chunk passwords is insecure because of fewer symbols and users were told to use  first and last initials, spouse’s initials, employment start date in the password advice. It is very easy for an attacker to predict users passwords if the attacker is familiar with the user
2.2.3 Password strength meters /ratings
This is a mechanism measuring strength of the password and giving users a numerical or statements  result  such as % ,‘weak’, ‘strong’ and ‘very strong’. Password strength meters explain the strength of the chosen password when a user is registering for an account. The websites like Gmail, PayPal and eBay use these meters. Online user research analyzed password strength meters [39]. The findings indicated that passwords created using password meter are difficult to guess unlike passwords created without using meters. Users create stronger passwords when they use strict password meters. But, strict meters  do not motivation users  and users ignore the strict  meters. In research of adaptive password strength meters (APSMs) to measure password strength [28]. APSM used Markov models [40] to measure a password’s strength as the collective probability of each character following the previous characters in the password. These probabilities can be calculated based on either a training set of passwords or the passwords currently in use. Although the authors claim that APSMs are better than any other proposed password strength metric to date as it can score passwords closer to the “ideal” password strength meter, there has not been conducted any formal usability study of APSMs and a practical security evaluation. Kelley et al. [41] implemented a cracking algorithm which calculated and estimated the number of guesses required to crack a password. The research calculated the percentage of passwords which could be cracked with the algorithm given a number of guesses. To compare cracking performance across algorithms, guess number calculators for several cracking algorithms on the same set of passwords can be implemented. Guess number calculators may be considered the more practical and efficient method of proactive password checking [42] than running a computationally intensive password cracking algorithm [43].
2.4	Usability of password security
Forcing users to create long complex passwords make users to write down or forget passwords. However, choosing weak and predictable passwords bring vulnerability to attacks. The experiments conducted to crack passwords proved the weaknesses of the user-chosen passwords [10, 44]. Research found out that very secure passwords are rarely used password and insecure passwords are frequently used [45]. Research examined the association between password security and usability [46]. The study found out that users have difficulty in remembering passwords and write down passwords.
2.4.1 Memorability
text based authentication has Memorability issue because user memory limitation make systems security vulnerable. Research found out that users have difficulty in remembering passwords [31]. Users write down, share passwords to avoid forgetting and resetting passwords. Vu et al. [21] tested text passwords memorability using different password policies. The findings were that it is difficult to remember five than three passwords, passwords created have a relationship  to the accounts in order not to forget. Chiasson et al. [47] The research contrasted memorability of many text knowledge based and PassPoints graphical passwords / sequence of points joined to form an image. The finding was that graphical passwords are easy to remember than text passwords.  Users adopt coping strategies to deal with challenge of remembering various passwords for different  accounts. Memorability coping strategies are writing down, sharing, using same passwords on various accounts e.t.c. Researches on choosing similar passwords across accounts of graphical passwords causing password interference [48,49,50].
2.4.1.1 Approaches  to cope with memorability of text passwords
Users have memory limitations hence adopt coping approaches to easily remember text passwords (Adams and Sasse, 1999Users adopt coping strategies to remember different passwords for various accounts (Gaw and Felten, 2006; Inglesand and Sasse, 2010). Stobert (2014) Reseach was done to find out how users manage many accounts and passwords and the finding was that users involved in approaches to cope with memorability like writing down, reuse, sharing etc .
Some approaches  to cope with passwords memorability:
Writing Down text passwords
When users are required to follow strict password creation policies or to change their password frequently, they are likely to resort to writing their passwords down to overcome the memorability issues. Results of several experiments showed that most users tend to write down their passwords except those who were given less stringent password creation rules to follow which allow users to create more memorable passwords (Adams and Sasse, 1999; Inglesant and Sasse, 2010). Although writing passwords down is usually considered to be insecure, some security researchers defend writing passwords down if they are kept somewhere safe (Cheswick, 2012).
 Reuse of passwords
 This is using same passwords for varius accounts. Password reuse is common with users (Chiasson et al., 2009a; Florencio and Herley, 2007; Stone-Gross et al., 2009). Password reuse is vulnerable to attackers guesses and a disclosed password set and this enable attacker to  access all user  accounts (Das et al., 2014; Florencio and Herley, 2007; Gaw and Felten, 2006; Hayashi and Hong, 2011; Stobert, 2014).
 Password Sharing password
Users  share  passwords to work on same data as a team (Adams and Sasse, 1999). Patrick (2008) research  found out that users share  accounts and passwords, but, security policy prohibit password sharing.
Choosing weak password
Most researches found out that users choose easily guessable passwords for easy memorability of passwords (Florencio and Herley, 2007; Inglesant and Sasse, 2010; Morris and Thompson, 1979; Weir et al., 2010) . According to Florencio, Herley and Coskun, (2007)  users lack lack knowledge in security risk hence choose weak passwords which are insecure but easily remembered. Research indicates that users have difficulty in understanding misunderstanding of actual  attackers capabilities (Gaw and Felten, 2006). Some researchers argue that the solution to coping strategies for passwords could be informing users about threats (Herley, Van Oorschot and Patrick, 2009; Whitten and Tygar, 1999)
Password Managers
A password manager is a software application that is used to store and manage the passwords that a user has for various online accounts and security features. Password managers store the passwords in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the password information with the help of a master password. it prevents the need to remember multiple passwords.
 Password managers store passwords and enter them automatically to the associated accounts. Browser-based password managers save passwords for a specific website and automatically input them when the website is revisited. Dedicated password managers either generate a password at login phase by hashing the user’s master password with the website information, or they keep the user’s passwords in a password wallet which is protected by a master password (Chiasson, Van Oorschot and Biddle, 2006). In either way, users have to use a master password. In case the master password is hacked, the attacker can gain access to users all accounts.
 2.4.2 System-assigned/generated  vs. user-chosen/created passwords
Users can create  own passwords or system assigned passwords randomly In text authentication password.  System passwords more secure than user chosen passwords because many users choose weak , easy to guess  passwords for  easy memorability. Many users are also unaware of the likelihood of predicting and ability of attackers to compromise passwords [31Research indicates that system assigned passwords are difficult to remember because they contain special characters [4]. Moreover, users find difficulty in remembering passwords without meaning for users [15, 21]. Research indicates that system-assigned passwords memorability depend on password strength [51]. Hence it is difficult for users to  remember system-assigned passwords without  system memory assistance. Research shows that  semantic content and cueing methods are used to  aid text password memory [52,53] .
Wright et al. [61] found  that passphrases are difficult to remember than system-assigned passwords and further studies are needed to evaluate effective forms of memory aid.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
4.1	Introduction
A web-based empirical study was carried out to investigate the assumption that users can create stronger and more memorable passwords if they are not enforced to comply with strict password policy rules. The study evaluates the effect of several password creation methods on the strength and memorability of users’ passwords. It also explores the users’ password behaviour and practices in either cases: with and without following strict password policy rules.
 The proposed password creation method is to enable users to create their own password creation formula to enhance password security. Most researchers found out that stringent password policies force users to adopt coping approaches. The study proposes a method including including information security training text . Password policies and advice were reviewed . The objective of the method is to provide users with guideline to create own secure passwords. Users will be inspired by the methods and create unique password creation formula. The method include an information security training to motivate users to create strong passwords.

4.2 Methodology of the empirical study
 4.2.1 The design and apparatus
The empirical study used the between-subject design where participants can be part of the experimental group or the control group, but cannot be part of both. There is one control group and one experimental group in the study. The strength and memorability of the passwords created by participants in each group were measured and compared to each other. While the participants in the control group were given some password policy rules to be followed when creating their passwords, the participants in the experimental group were given several password creation methods as examples to create their own formula to compose passwords without having to follow any rules.
Two different websites were created to collect data for this empirical study: one for the experimental group and one for the control group. The apparatus used in this study is as below:
 – A password guideline including five password composition rules for the control group.
 – A password guideline including three sample password creation methods and a persuasive message and important notes for the experimental group.
 – A password register/login page of a web site for the control group
. – A password register/login page of a website for the experimental group
. – Two sets of questionnaires: one for the control group and one for the experimental group
. – Consent forms to read and accept for all participants.
 Once the participants in each group had signed up, they were provided with a message and a survey link directing them to another website to fill out a questionnaire. While the questionnaire given to the control group included 19 questions, the experimental group’s questionnaire included 30 questions. The questions in the control group’s questionnaire were common for both group. The average time to complete the questionnaire was approximately 15 minutes for the experimental group and 10 minutes for the control group.
 As stated above, the password guidelines which were distributed to the participants are different according to the group to which they were assigned. The participants in the control group received a set of password composition rules are as below:
The password composition rules for the control group:
– Your password must be at least 8 characters long
– Your password must contain at least one upper case, one lower case, one number and one special keyboard character
 – Your password should not contain your username
 – You should use different passwords across different accounts
 – Your password should not be easily guessable
The participants in the experimental group were given a persuasive message telling them that it is possible to create strong and memorable passwords applying some methods. The message attempts to persuade participants to create a unique formula; thus, they could turn even a simple word to a complex password which is hard to crack. In addition to this message, participants in the experimental group were also given these methods with examples.
 The password guideline of the experimental group was framed using logical reasoning by providing explanations such as the fact that if users create weak passwords for ordinary websites, a crafty hacker can obtain that password easily. If using the same or similar password is the user’s habit, it would not be difficult for the hacker to guess the other passwords created for important accounts such as bank account. The password guideline including the persuasive message and password composition methods given to the experimental group are as follows:
 The participants were shown a register/login page to enter their username and password. At the beginning of the empirical study, the participants were assigned a unique ID number. The final apparatus involved in the study is the questionnaires of the control and experimental group. The control group’s questionnaire contains several questions on demographic details of the participants and some questions related to password constructions and usage. In addition to these questions, experimental group’s questionnaire contains some questions to find out the user satisfaction with the given methods and the effect of the methods on users’ password choice.
The questions in the questionnaires were set to understand the reasons for the participants’ password practices and determine the influence of proposed password guideline on password strength and memorability. A pilot survey was conducted before with fewer participants to test the quality of the questions. The content of several questions in the preliminary questionnaires was changed to better suit the aim of the study. Also, some previous studies were reviewed that used the several materials and questions [50,64]. Not only the survey questions but also the proposed password guideline including three password creation methods were tested with a small number of participants before the main experiment. In this way, the methods were examined whether they are readable and applicable easily.

You can create very strong passwords with simple and memorable methods to protect your accounts! Please read carefully and understand the logic or bases of the methods
 Before signing in, please use the methods given below to create your password. These methods offer a high level of security by leading you to create your own encryption formula to produce strong passwords from memorable words. Once you have understood the encrypting logic behind the manipulation of memorable words with equally memorable strings of numbers to create your very own formula, you will be able to transform words and numbers that are memorable for you, into very strong passwords. Memorable words mixed appropriately with memorable strings of numbers leads to strong passwords.
 Important Note
 You should choose words and numbers unrelated to your personal details. For example, don’t encrypt your name or surname. And don’t use strings of numbers that indicate your date of birth. Even though others do not have a clue about your formula, it is risky.
 Remember that password selection is very important to protect your confidential data. Without exception, you should care about your password selection for anything from ordinary websites to bank accounts. A crafty hacker can easily obtain your weak password within seconds. Also remember that if you use very similar passwords across different accounts, and, once the hackers have obtained one of your passwords, they can easily guess the others. Below are examples of workable methods. You should not apply exactly any of the examples as your own password. The examples are given only to show the possibilities of good encryption formulation that consequently lead you to think of your own encryption formulation resulting in a memorable formula.
 Method-1
 Step 1: Pick a word. Let’s say, “education” as our plain password.
Step 2: Specify a number. Let’s say, 347. So we have the word “education” and the number “347”. Let’s encrypt them.
Step 3: Convert the 3rd, 4th and 7th letters of the word “education” to upper case. We now have “edUCatIon”.
Step 4: Place the numbers 3, 4 and 7 after each of the upper case letters. This gives us “edU3C4atI7on”.
Step 5: Change the value of each of the numbers in Step 4 by increasing or decreasing each. In this case, we will choose to increase each by 2. Therefore 3 + 2 becomes 5, 4 + 2 becomes 6 and, 7 + 2 becomes 9. So now we have the strong password “edU56atI9on”.
it! It is almost impossible to guess and very hard to crack. You can even write the plain password somewhere to help you remember it. As long as no one knows your formula that converts a plain password into a strong password, plain passwords are meaningless to them. Here’s another example. Let’s pick a Turkish word and the number 148. Our plain password here is “bilgisayar.” When we applied the same formula, this plain password converts into the strong password “B3ilG6isaY10ar”.
Method-2
Step 1: Choose a string of plain numbers. Let’s choose the numbers “12345”.
Step 2: Specify a combination of letters and keyboard characters. Let’s specify “m_y_”. (Letters separated by underscores).
Step 3: Mix the string of plain numbers with the combination of letters and keyboard characters. In this case, we sequentially alternate the individual numbers of Step1 with the letters and keyboard characters of Step 2. Thus, we get the strong password “1m2_3y4_5”.
 Method-3
If you want to use meaningful words and phrases you have to create a very long password combining letters, numbers and other keyboard characters. For example, “myfavouritechicredshoes-size4.” This phrase is meaningful to you, so you can remember it easily, but for other people it should be hard to guess. You can combine unrelated words which you can associate. An example of this is “elephant.zoo.travel.Africa”. An elephant might remind you of a zoo and a travel to Africa.
Important Notes
– You can pick a related simple password or add some more characters to your encrypted password to remind you of the site for which you create the password.
– You should not use the same examples and/or formulas given in the above methods. You should create your own.
 – You should use different passwords for different accounts.
 – You should never share your passwords and/or your formula with anyone.

 – You can apply your formula to different words and numbers to create different passwords.
4.2.2 The procedure
The participants were informed about the study and recruited using social media posts and flayers hanged on school boards in several universities in UK, USA and Turkey. Links of both websites were posted on social media platforms, and potential participants were asked to choose only one of them to sign up. The place of the links was changed on different posts and flayers as users might tend to click or type the first one. In the last days of the experiment, only the link of the website which has lesser signed-up participants was shared to recruit more people. This helped to avoid the imbalance between the numbers of participants in the control and experimental groups. Also, only university students’ responses included in the empirical study.
 At the beginning of the empirical study, all participants were automatically assigned a unique ID number. These ID numbers were used to match the participants’ credentials and questionnaire responses. The participants in both groups were given a brief information about the study and asked to read and accept the consent form to participate. Once they had accepted the consent form, they were able to sign up their website. For those participants who were interested in getting more information about the study researcher’s, contact information was provided in the consent form. As presented above, participants received different password guidelines while signing up. After the participants signed up the websites successfully, they were asked to click the provided link which would direct them to the survey website to fill the questionnaire. Before filling the questionnaire, a brief introduction was provided to participants informing them about the approximate time which the questionnaire would take. Finally, the empirical study was finished with a message of thanks to participants for their participation.
The participants were asked to login again after a week and a month to find out whether they recall their passwords. The procedure of the study was exactly the same for both groups except the password guidelines and additional questions in the experimental group’s questionnaire

4.2.3 The measurements
There are several measurements involved in the empirical study: password strength, password length, memorability, password policy compliance, use of the given methods, user satisfaction and persuasiveness. The password strength was measured using tools known as the “Password Meter” [45] and “How Secure is my Password?” [15].
 “Password Meter” measures the password strength using a combination of several important attributes that constitute a particular password, such as length (i.e. number of the characters), the frequency of uppercase, lowercase, numerical characters and alphanumeric characters (i.e. punctuation and mathematical symbols). Password strength calculation is made by adding points if the password meets the requirements, and deducting points if not. The tool categorises the passwords by giving scores where the maximum score is 100% according to complexity of the password. The passwords will be categorised as follows: very weak (0% ≤ password score < 20%), weak (20% ≤ password score < 40%), good (40% ≤ password score < 60%), strong (60% ≤ password score < 80%) and very strong (80% ≤ password score ≤ 100).
 “How Secure is my Password?” measures the time in which the password entered could possibly be cracked by a computer. The tool takes into consideration the length, whether the password given looks like a dictionary word and the character variety while measuring the estimated cracking time.
Using both tools, participants’ passwords were measured. Based on results of the measurement, passwords were evaluated according to their strength level and possible cracking time.
The next element that was also measured in this study is the memorability. To evaluate the recall rate, the participants were asked to login to the websites after a week and after a month. To carry out the measurement of memorability, participants were given numbers where 0 indicates that user could not login successfully, 1 indicates that user logged in successfully in the first attempt and 2 indicates that user logged in successfully after a few attempts.
The other measurement in the study was password policy compliance. Since the participants in the control group must follow the given password policy rules, the measurement was conducted to find out whether the participants in the experimental group applied these rules to their passwords. Passwords were given scores for each requirement where 0 indicates that the related rules had not been applied and 1 indicates that the related rules had been applied by the participant. Briefly, the measurement showed how close each participant in the experimental group followed the requirements given in the password guideline of the control group.
Use of given methods, user satisfaction and persuasiveness were measured based on questionnaire responses of the participants in the experimental group to evaluate the password guidelines given them.
4.2.4 Demographics
308 people participated in this study. 152 of them were in the experimental group, and they created passwords after reading a persuasive text on how to create strong and memorable passwords. 156 people were in the control group where they had to follow five commonly used instructions to create a password. 142 people in the experimental group and 95 people in the control group filled out a follow-up questionnaire including questions about their password creating habits and their thoughts of given methods. Therefore, demographics and survey analyses were run for 237 participants whereas password strength, compliance and memorability scores were analysed for all 308 participants.
The participants are recruited from college students studying in some universities in UK, USA and Turkey. Undergraduate students as well as the postgraduate students participated in the study. Some of the participants have computer science related background.
There were 111 females and 126 male participants. 90.8% of the experimental group and 86.3% of the control group were aged between 18–35 years. Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate the demographic details of the participants involved in the empirical study.
 The number of participants who are currently in an undergraduate programme (n = 108) and in a postgraduate programme (n = 129) was close. Additionally, most of the participants did not have a background in computer science, and only 19% of all participants were from a computer science related major.

4 Results
4.1 The results and analysis of the empirical study
In the following sections, results and analysis of the empirical study are presented in detail.
 4.1.1 The Password analysis
 Experimental and control conditions were compared in terms of password strength, password length and compliance to the common password policy rules, which were compulsory for control condition. The aim was to see whether people in experimental condition were also following those guidelines unintentionally while creating passwords in line with other methods provided. Table 1 presents the password analysis of the empirical study.
 Password strength In this study, password strength was scored out of 100 for each password individually. Though almost the same number of participants in experimental and control groups think they have strong passwords (62.7% vs. 61.1% respectively), an independent samples t test (t (306) = 15.617, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.44) proved that there was a difference in password strength between conditions (see Fig. 4). The experimental group (M = 89.08, SD = 8.84) created stronger passwords than the control group (M = 71.95, SD = 10.36).
According to the Password Meter, the passwords of the control group and the experimental group are categorised, respectively, as strong and very strong. According to the results, people are not good at predicting the strength of their own passwords. As Fig. 5 indicates that neither in the control group (t(93) = −1.375, p = 0.172) nor in the experimental group (t(140) = 0.034, p = 0.973) there were difference in terms of password strength between those who thought their passwords were hard to crack and those who thought their passwords were easy to crack. Password length Password length was also compared between groups with an independent samples t test analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the results showed that there existed a homogeneity of variance problem, such that Levene’s test for equality of variances was significant (p < 0.001). However, the t test without equal variances assumption was also significant (t(200) = 9.986, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.33). Experimental group (M = 13.39, SD = 4.35) created significantly longer passwords than control group (M = 9.59, SD = 1.80).
Additionally, password length is correlated with password strength. A strong positive Pearson’s correlation exists between them, such that the longer the passwords, the stronger they are (r = 0.775, n = 301, p < 0.001). Figure 7 demonstrates the relationship of number of the characters in the password and the password strength.
 To check for the interaction of experimental group and password length, password length scores were recoded as a categorical variable with median split method, where the length scores of both groups were divided into two groups: shorter passwords and longer passwords. Then, a 2 (experimental group)×2 (password length) factorial ANOVA was computed. This ANOVA yielded significant results both for the password length (F(1, 304) = 166.079, p < 0.001) and for the experimental condition (F(1, 304) = 334.695, p < 0.001). However, there was not an interaction of the two variables (F(1, 304) = 0.649, p = 0.421). Experimental group was better at creating strong passwords both for longer passwords (M = 95.71, SD = 8.84 vs. M = 78.56, SD = 8.51) and for shorter passwords (M = 83.41, SD = 7.61 vs. M = 67.71, SD = 10.36). Figure 8 compares the strength of short and long passwords of experimental and control group. In this analysis, there was a homogeneity of variance problem as well. However, when the analysis is repeated after data reduction based on outlier analysis with Cook’s distance values, neither the results changed, nor the homogeneity problem was solved. Since ANOVA is considered a robust test against the equal variances assumption and since the significance levels reached in the analysis were acceptable even at conservative perspective, these results were considered acceptable. Additionally, since the unequal variances are almost inevitable in this empirical design due to the difference in number of strategies given to the participants in both conditions, no data were excluded from the analyses.
Password compliance At the beginning of the empirical study, the control group was required to follow a password guideline including the following password composition rules: The password should contain: 1. at least 8 characters 2. at least one upper case 3. at least one lower case 4. at least one numerical character 5. at least one special keyboard character.

The password should not contain:
1. The username
Most of the web applications require users to apply at least 4 of these rules while creating a password. However, the participants in the experimental group were not imposed to use them to compose their passwords. Instead, their password guidelines included persuasive elements aimed at motivating users to create passwords which automatically provided these requirements.
To see whether the experimental group also complied with the rules required for the control group, each password was coded in a binary format (1 for compliance and 0 for incompliance). Later, passwords were given a score as the total number of compliance across six items. Although the experimental group’s compliance score was significantly different (t(151) = −17.199, p < 0.001) from 6, the score of the control group, still 89.5% of the participants in the experimental group complied with four or more password creation rules (see Fig. 9).
The experimental group’s passwords were stronger than the control group’s passwords, which were obliged to comply all the strategies and therefore have the compliance score of 6. This result suggested that compliance to the commonly used password criteria was not a guarantee of strong passwords (see Fig. 10).
The relationship between compliance and password strength was rather complicated. A univariate ANOVA was run to compare password strength, and the compliance scores 2 and 3 were collapsed due to the number of data in each group. So, there was a significant difference between groups F(3, 304) = 47.905, p < 0.001. A Tukey’s post hoc test showed that this difference stems from the highest compliance group, which differed from all other groups with 95% confidence intervals, as shown in Table 2.
Memorability How likely people were to remember a password they create is another central point. In this study, first, memorability of a password after a week and after a month was compared across groups with a 2 (time: week vs. month memorability)×2 (experimental group) factorial ANOVA. As shown in Fig. 11, results indicated that memorability significantly decreases as time passes (F(1, 306) = 59.712, p < 0.001). Memorability after a week (M = 1.31, SD = 0.83) was significantly higher than memorability after a month (M = 0.85, SD = 0.81), where a score of 2 indicates correctly remembering a password at first trial, score of 1 indicates correct remembering at many trials, and a score of 0 indicates failing to remember. Additionally, the chances of correct retrieval were higher for experimental group (M = 1.27, SD = 0.05) than the control group (M = 0.90, SD = 0.05; F(1, 306) = 28.320, p < 0.001). This result is in line with experimental group’s predictions about memorability, where 86% of participants thought they would remember the password correctly after a week, and 76% of them thought they would remember correctly after a month (see Fig. 12). Hence, no interaction between the experimental group and time was found (F(1.306) = 0.425, p = 0.515).
To investigate how the conditions were distributed across retrieval levels, two Chi-square analyses were run. For the memorability of a week, the Chi-square test was significant, χ2(1, N = 308) = 15.487, p < 0.001, which meant that experimental group and control group differed from each other at retrieval performances (see Fig. 13). Grouped comparisons supported that the significance stemmed from differences at all levels. In a week period, the experimental group was better at both correct retrieval at first trial (101 vs. 69 participants) whereas the control group either failed to remember more than the experimental group (28 vs. 45) or retrieved correctly at many trials with higher frequency (23 vs. 42).
The second Chi-square analysis showed that the experi mental group (57 vs. 25 participants) again performed better at correct retrieval at first trial, χ2(1, N = 308) = 20.147, p < 0.001. Similarly, the control group failed more to remember their passwords correctly (49 vs. 80 participants) after a month.
Use of password creation methods in the experimental group Among the 142 participants who took the follow-up questionnaire, 3 participants were excluded from the following analyses since they selected more than one option at the same time. Among the remaining participants in the experimental group, most of them preferred the third method (34%) (see Sect. 4.2.1 for the details of the given methods). The distribution can be seen in Fig. 14.

Fig. 16 Estimated password cracking times

Moreover, password creation methods were compared in terms of how strong passwords the participants created by applying these methods (see Fig. 15). A univariate ANOVA showed that passwords created by different methods were significantly different, F(3, 135) = 30.097, p < 0.001.
 To understand which methods are creating the difference, a Tukey’s HSD post hoc test was run, and it resulted that the passwords created by applying any of the methods are stronger than the passwords created without applying the given methods (stated as none of them in the figures), with 95% confidence interval (see Table 3). Additionally, passwords created with method three were slightly stronger than the passwords created with method two (p = 0.047).
Password cracking times To measure the strength of the passwords in the experimental and control group in another way, a tool, namely “How Secure is My Password,” was also used. This tool measures the estimated cracking time of the created passwords. When the passwords were analysed based on the time required to crack them, data indicated that only control group participants and the participants in the experimental group who did not utilise any of the given methods created passwords which are easier to crack (i.e. passwords which could be broken in less than a year). Additionally, when the experimental methods were compared to each other, most of the participants who used method two created passwords to be cracked in decades, as opposed to the participants who preferred the first or the third method. This result is in line with password strength results, which indicated method two created slightly less strong passwords than methods one and three. Estimated password cracking times for both groups’ passwords are shown in Fig. 16.

5.1.2 The results based on the survey responses
Password usage
Among the participants who conducted the questionnaire, 80.3% of the experimental group and 66.3% of the control group reported that they did not experience any password security failure before. Moreover, only 39.4% of the experimental group and 31.6% of the control group reported that they do not write down their passwords anywhere, while 41.5% of the experimental group and 38.9% of the control group write their passwords somewhere safe and 19% of the experimental group and 29.5% of the control group prefer somewhere accessible. Results also showed users’ password preferences across different accounts vary. As seen in Fig. 17, most of the users tend to choose stronger passwords for their personal email accounts than the work emails.
User satisfaction
Participants in the experimental group were asked about their experience of using the new methods presented to them. As illustrated in Fig. 18, most of the participants reported that they found the given methods useful to create a password for the current empirical study (87%) and they were likely to use given methods to create passwords in the future (79%).
 Additionally, they rated their experience further in terms of fun and easiness. Most of the participants agreed that using the provided methods was easy (61%) and more than half of the participants evaluated the methods as fun to apply (54%). A larger body of participants (80%) reported that using the given methods to create secure passwords is worth the time spent on them. Moreover, most of the participants (85% agreed that these methods were more efficient than the commonly used strict password creating rules, in terms of creating strong and memorable passwords (see Fig. 19).
Persuasiveness
Finally, it seemed like the methods provided to the experimental group persuaded them not to use any of the coping strategies (see Fig. 20). Most of them reported they would not write down their passwords (76%), not share their passwords with other people (75%) and not reuse the passwords they created once (73%).
6 Discussion
The details of the web-based empirical study are presented in the previous sections. The aim of this study was to investigate whether users can create stronger and more memorable passwords if they are not enforced to comply with strict password policy rules. The study examined the efficiency of a persuasive text along with the three password composition methods on motivating users to create stronger and memorable passwords.
The results indicate that passwords created by users who receive password guidelines including a persuasive text and sample password creation methods are stronger compared to passwords created by those who are given the password guidelines including strict password composition rules. The results also showed that the participants, who applied the given methods, remembered their passwords better than the ones who followed the usual password policy rules.
Thus, these findings suggest that it is a good idea for providing a message in the password guideline to persuade users to create their own password composition formula. When the message is supported with the example methods of password composition, it becomes possible to create strong passwords without burdening their memory to remember them. In this study, most of the participants in the experimental group spent time to read the information and applied the given methods to produce passwords, maybe just to help a research study by participating. However, in real life, users may not make an effort to read the information provided in the password guidelines unless they have to. Zakaria [64] suggested that one possible way to overcome this is to make reading and understanding the password guidelines compulsory before constructing a password. In particular, if the systems or applications require a high level of password security, this might be a reasonable solution. Another solution is visualisation of password attacks in password guideline to make users aware of the threats [67]. Ur et al. [56] stated that password advice should focus on promoting human algorithms for developing passwords, in addition to visualising threats in the password guideline. Some researchers claimed that users should be guided to save their limited mental capacity for passwords for high-value accounts [21,44,56].
The methods given in the password guidelines of the experimental group allowed users to create passwords which spontaneously meet the requirements of the password policy which was given to the control group as password guideline. In other words, most of the participants created passwords which are longer than 8 characters, including upper and lower cases, also numbers and special keyboard characters. However, the study showed that complying with these rules does not always guarantee creating strong passwords.
There are more attributes such as password length and not including meaningful words in passwords that affect the password strength. Therefore, two tools were used to measure password strength considering the frequency and variety of characters as well as the similarity to the dictionary words. Although, the results of the measurements performed with the Password Meter showed that the control group’s passwords are less strong than the experimental group’s, they were still in the “strong” category. However, the difference between the cracking times measured with the “How Secure is my Password” is huge. Most of the passwords of the control group categorised as strong seemed likely to be cracked in a day. The reason of this difference is that the second tool takes into consideration whether the password looks like a dictionary word besides measuring the character variability. The passwords including meaningful details such as dictionary words are likely to crack in short times even if they are composed of different characters. As a result, both measurements yielded results in support of password guideline including persuasive message and the example password creation methods.
Furthermore, questionnaire responses showed that the given methods are efficient to persuade users to abandon coping strategies to remember their passwords. Users in the experimental group seemed to be willing to comply with the password guideline and apply the given methods. However, a little more than half of the participants (54%) found the methods fun to apply. To increase the user satisfaction and lessen more the memory burden, images can be included in the password creation process. Users can also be supported by some feedback such as a traditional password meter or an emoji-based approach during the password selection. This might also make the password creation process fun for them [24].
There is a lack of ecological validity in generalising the findings to real life as the study is not conducted with a real application in use. The participants knew that the websites were created for a research study and they created passwords for helping the study. If users created passwords for a real website to perform their own tasks, quality of the passwords and compliance with the guidelines might have been different. On the other hand, the password guideline including several password creation tips provided to the experimental group is somewhat long to read. Therefore, users might not be willing to read it when they create a password in real life. This reduces the practicability of the proposed guideline. Another issue about the study is the unusual demographics of the experimental group. The participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. However, number of the participants who have high education level in the experimental group is more than the control group. This situation might have affected the password strength rates in the experimental group.
Moreover, the password creation methods provided to the users in the experimental group were not evaluated separately. Findings show that there was an apparent preference towards the third method so why it was more popular with the users could have also been investigated. Similarly, to point out the differences between the results of the participants from different countries could have been an interesting study. Unfortunately, in this study, the data and responses of all participants in the same group were evaluated together
7 Conclusion and further research
Although the use of passwords as an authentication method has been extensively studied in the past, there are no empirical studies that test the effectiveness of password creation methods. Thus, the contribution of this research and its implications for both research and practice are significant.
As the results of the empirical studies indicated, the proposed password guideline improves the security and memorability of user-chosen passwords. Rather than obliging users to follow strict password policy rules, motivating and directing them to create strong and memorable passwords seems more efficient and usable way.
Thus far, the results generally have shown some promising findings; however, the practicability of this new password guideline may be an issue in real world, as stated above. The password guideline can be improved adding visual elements in the guideline to make reading the given information process interesting. It would probably be useful to attract users’ attention and make the password creation process more enjoyable. Also, implementing the proposed password guideline into different kinds of applications which require different levels of security and conducting a further empirical study with different user groups involving more participants would be useful. Also, giving users some feedback during the password selection process such as meter-based ratings would motivate users to choose more secure passwords. Moreover, the literature on persuasion suggests that persuasion attempts are more likely to succeed if the persons are aware of the situation. Thus, adding some attributes to the password guideline informing users about possible attacks if they choose weak passwords might improve the compliance to password guideline.
